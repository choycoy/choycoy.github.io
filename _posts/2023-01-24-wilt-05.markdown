# Python Data Handling
Data storage methods we process: CSV, html, XML, JSON
## 1. Comma Separate Values
`CSV`: text file with fields separated by **commas(,)**,it is easy to think of `excel` from data as a data format for writing regardless of program, it is also created by dividing it with tabs(TSV) and spaces(SSV), commonly called character-separated values(CSV), in excel, it can be used as a `save name as` function.
- Creating CSV file using excel
<br>
1) download excel file which you want create
<br>
2) open file
<br>
3) file -> save name as -> click the option CSV -> enter the file name
<br>
4) open file with notepad

- Read/Write CSV file using python: like reading text file, process data line by line

```
line_couter = 0
data_header = []
customer_list = []

with open("example.csv") as customer_data:
    while True:
        data = customer_data.readline()
        if not data: break
        if line_counter == 0
            data_header = data.split(",")
        else :
            customer_list.append(data.split(","))
        line_counter += 1

print("Header: \t", data_header)
for i in range(0,10):
    print("Data", i, ":\t\t", customer_list[i])
print(len(customer_list))
```

- Process CSV as a CSV object
When processing data in the form of a text file, `pre-processing` is required for (",") in sentences, python provides a csv object to simply handle CSV files.
<br>
<br>
Using the CSV object
```
import csv
reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter = ',', quotechar ='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)
```
