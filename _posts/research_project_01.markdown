ðŸ’¡ This post introduces the research for the project "A Dish Recommendation System".
{: .notice--warning}
# A Dish Recommendation System
The aim of this project is to recommend new dishes that suits your taste that **you have not eaten before** by automatically analysing the dishes you had. This recommendation algorithm is so robust that many people find their all-time favourite dish.

## A Dish Recommendation System vs A Restaurant Recommendation
To **specify the individual taste**, the range of what we want to recommend for you is reduced such as not considering the whole menu in the restaurant. For example, even though the restaurants normally have the most popular menu or friends recommend you their best menu after they tried the restaurant, you may be much satisfied with what you just chose randomly by your taste than the recommend menu by others. This happens because people have different taste.

## The algorithm
(1) Collaborative Filtering: -

(2) Content-based Filtering/NLP
<br>
(3) CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)
<br>

## The functions
In addition, since one of the biggest advantages in terms of having a meal is the cost, the option function of cost should be available. For example, there are times when you wan to have a delicious meal without considering the price of the food. Like special days.
